    "One of the most important things to get in the habit of when developing code is using code versioning control software.  In this class we will be using a software called **git**. \n",
    "For an individual user code versioning software has three useful advantages. \n",
    "The first advantage of using code versioning is that it works as a very effective backup system. Git makes a copy of your directory and then stores changes over time to that tree.  This backup system allows you to quickly find bugs you have introduced into your code.  You can ask git to provide you with the differences between the current version of the code and a working version.  Finally, because we are going to use a remote repository, operating on multiple machines with a single code base becomes simpler.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can initialize a new git repository using the shell command `git init`. Type `!` at the beginning of your command to tell Jupyter to run your command as a shell command rather than a notebook command. In the next cell, initialize your current directory as a git repository."
