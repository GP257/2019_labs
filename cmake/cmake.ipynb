    "At some level Cmake is simply a tool for generating makefiles.  You tell Cmake what you want to build by writing `CmakeLists.txt` files.  It checks that the computer supports what you want to build (for example that it has the correct compiler) and then generates rules to build your software.  In this class we will use a consistent directory structure.  Our root directory for code and rules will be named `src`. Below you can see the listing of the `src` directory for our example."

    "There are many different ways to calculate $\\pi$.  One of the more intuitive methods is to imagine a 2D space, spanning from 0 to 1 in $x$ and $y$, and imagine 1/4 of a cirle with radius 1 going from (0,1) to (1,0).  If you were to choose a random location in that 2D space, what are the chances it would be within the circle?  It is easy to prove mathematically that the odds are $\\pi \\over 4$. We can then get an approximation of $\\pi$ by choosing more and more random locations. You can see a Python implementation below."
