    "In this class you will be using **Jupyter notebooks** to complete your assignments. This assignment is a brief  introduction to the main features you will be using.  Notebooks are composed of cells. Each cell is one of four types: Markdown, Code, Raw NB Convert, and Heading. In this class you will be using the first two types.  You can change the type of a cell through the pull-down menu above.  This cell is an example of a markdown cell. Markdown cells are used for text. You can edit the contents of a cell by clicking on it and hitting the `enter` key, or by double-clicking it. You can execute a cell by either hitting the `Run` icon above or by hitting the `shift` and `enter` keys simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "The menu bar above also gives you the option of saving, adding a cell, cutting a cell, copying and pasting, moving to the next or previous cell, stopping a cell, or restarting the notebook. Begin by executing this cell. "
